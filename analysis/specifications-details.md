**"Specific" Details**
* The game uses real-world data from both green and yellow taxi trip data.
* If a player is "For Hire", they are eligible to pick-up a trip in their current
cell for the current round.
* If a trip is awarded prior to the end of a shift, it will be completed even
if the drop-off time is after the allowed time.
* After the final trip or default action of a shift, the player must choose when
and where to start the next shift.
* Any shifts not completed by the end of the game are lost.
* Communication with the game platform is performed via StdIn & StdOut; as such,
a player may maintain state (within available memory resources) between turns.
* The implementation of the model should be consistent with the plan featured
in the group presentation. Significant changes should be discussed with the
subject coordinator.
* Final report of up to 50 pages should include the design, building, and
refinement of the model.
