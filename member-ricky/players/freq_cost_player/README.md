# Predict best destination cell based on frequency/cost with linear regression model

(Prebuilt) Linear regression model

- Predictor: PickupCell, day_of_week, minute_of_day
- Response: Frequency

(Runtime)

- Determine cost to all destination cells
- Fit destination cell, compupted arrival time and day of week into linear regression to predict frequency
- Compute frequncy/cost
- Find max freqency/cost
- List cells leading to destination cells.
