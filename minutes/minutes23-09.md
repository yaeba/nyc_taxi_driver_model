**Previous Minutes Review:**
*  Each member completed their slides and draft speech.
*  Noticeable overlaps and disconnection between speakers; these shall be
addressed in the next meeting.

**Agenda of Today's Meeting:**
* Determine meetup for Wednesday to run through presentation multiple
times. Aim to achieve a presentation time of less than 10 minutes.

**Action Items:**
1.  <Each Member> Run through presentations individually. Aim to achieve less
than 2.5 minutes since going over the time limit of 10 minutes will likely 
result in a point deduction.
2.  Run through the slides and comment on areas which could use improvement.

**Agenda for Next Meeting:**
1.  Fully integrate each member's slides and speech to form a complete 
presentation that flows nicely.
